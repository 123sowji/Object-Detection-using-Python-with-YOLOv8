# Object-Detection-using-Python-with-YOLOv8
Object Detection using YOLOv8 A custom object detection model was developed using YOLOv8. The dataset was collected and annotated with LabelImg, then trained and fine-tuned with data augmentation to improve accuracy. The model was evaluated using mAP, precision, and recall, and deployed for real-time detection through OpenCV with a webcam feed.
